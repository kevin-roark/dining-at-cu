                          Stop pretending like it isn't hard. It is, but get over it! Or should we say it used to be?
                          That's right, the pain of menu-checking, date-lookup, reading ... it's all over. For you.
                          Our intuitive system takes the pain and fear of dining and abstracts it into the ether.

                          Other dining websites are slow and don't work. Looked at any of them lately? Didn't think so.
                          Don't even think about it. Just punch in the date right here and watch the data unfold.
                          You'll know whats on the menu and eat what you want - for once.

                          Just check the menu.
